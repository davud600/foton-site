    "operationGreenVeilIntro": "Our database, primarily focused on Kosovo's agriculture, contains extensive labeled multispectral data used to train our model, which predicts specific indicators related to crop health and field conditions. This is a crucial tool to help farmers save on resource and therefore expenses while also ensuring better quality and yield.",
    "operationGreenVeilDetails": "Through advanced processing, we translate vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, SAVI, IPVI), cumulative Growing Degree Days (GDDs), and historical rainfall and temperature data into actionable insights. The resulting information includes the following indicators and more:",
